# Climber app with TFT display 
The project contains 9 NPN phototransistors, ADC (ADS1115) with I^2C interface, TFT display 2.8" (ROHS) with SPI interface, Raspberry Pi 4B, simple button and LED diodes (colors with the Bulgarian flag - white, green, red). The climber wall is 3D-printed. The LEDs are powered by 6V battery. 
The climber wall has 3 checkpoints. It is tested with 3D-printed black cap. 
Phototransistors work as keys. The variable <i>treshhold</i> should be changed according to current circumstances and power of the LEDs.

The libraries used for the usage of the display are Python Pillow (v9.5), Adafruit Blinka and Adafruit-circuitpython-rgb-display.
